		<p>We provide a nutritious daily school meal to children who would otherwise go hungry. This meal encourages children to attend school and enables them to <br>concentrate and learn while they are there. Children are sustainably supported at all stages of their education â€“ from pre-school, through to primary and<br> secondary school and after-school programs. By offering meals in schools, the Lunchbox Fund not only helps improve the children's health and nutritional status but also promotes better school attendance and academic performance. For many children, the meals provided by the Lunchbox Fund might be the only food they receive throughout the day, making it a critical source of support.</p>
