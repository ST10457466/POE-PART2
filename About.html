		<p>The Lunchbox Fund is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing nutritious meals to underprivileged school children, particularly in South Africa. It was founded in 2005 with the mission to help combat hunger and malnutrition among children from low-income communities by ensuring they receive at least one healthy meal during the school day.</p>

		<p>The organization uses sustainable food programs and partners with schools, community organizations, and local suppliers to maximize impact. Their work also helps address larger systemic issues such as food insecurity and poverty. Over the years, the Lunchbox Fund has grown and expanded its reach, playing a significant role in improving the lives of many vulnerable children.</p>
